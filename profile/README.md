1-5 General Constraint

Understanding the limitations and constraints of a project is crucial for its successful execution and management. Here are the general constraints for the Fix Flex project:

 Time Constraint: The project is subject to a specific timeline, which includes deadlines for each phase and the final rollout date. Adhering to this schedule is vital to ensure timely completion and launch. The time constraint encompasses not only the duration of tasks but also the allocation of resources and coordination among different project components.

 Scope Constraint: This defines the boundaries of the project, including its goals, deliverables, features, and functions. The scope outlines the tasks required to complete the project and sets the parameters within which the project must be developed. It is essential to maintain a clear and focused scope to avoid scope creep, which can lead to delays and additional costs.

 Cost Constraint: The budget of the project is a critical constraint, encompassing all financial resources required for timely and effective completion within the defined scope. However, the cost constraint is not limited to monetary expenditure alone; it also includes resource allocation, such as time, labor, and material resources. Effective cost management is crucial to ensure that the project does not exceed its financial limitations.

 Collecting Raw Data: Gathering the necessary data for the project poses its own set of challenges. These include:

- Concept of Data Collection: Understanding what data is needed, why it is needed, and how it will be used is fundamental to the data collection process.
- Types of Data: Identifying the types of data and their sources is crucial for informed decision-making and project planning.
- Issues to be Considered for Data Collection: Addressing potential issues such as data privacy, accuracy, and relevance is essential for effective data collection.
- Methods of Primary Data Collection: Determining the most suitable methods for gathering primary data is vital for obtaining accurate and useful information.

By acknowledging and managing these constraints, the Fix Flex project can be effectively guided towards successful completion, ensuring that it meets its intended goals within the set time frame, scope, and budget, and with the necessary data in hand.

Chapter 2
Planning and Analysis

Development approach and methodology
System Development Life Cycle
We followed system development life cycle approach in developing this project with its 7 phases, planning, analysis, design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.

Methodology
We followed Agile analysis and design methodology in developing, this project and developed all related UML diagrams, represented in this document later.

Software development phases:

2.4 Analysis of the new system
2.4.1 User requirements

• This explains what the user will get through the site or application that
you are using or the user what will it does inside the system?
• Often referred to as user needs, describe what the user does with the
system, such as activities which users should be able to do. User
requirements are documented in the User Requirements
Document (URD) using narrative text. User requirements are signed in Generic by the user and used as the primary input for creating system requirements.

Our FixFlex will consist of the following users:
1 - The User:

• He can create an account for the platform by registering his basic data (first name, last name, email, password, mobile number, address).

• He can then log in (email, password).

• upload his own profile image.

• update his own profile details.

• Users can post tasks they need help with, providing details (title, category, details, location, date, time, budget).
• The user receives offers from the Tasker and can accept or reject it.

• Users can track the status of their posted tasks and receive notifications on updates.

• Users and taskers can communicate in real-time through the built-in chat system.

• Users can rate taskers and leave reviews based on their experience.

• Users can payment cash or online payment.

1.1-Tasker:
It can do everything that the user does in addition to:

• Uploading the type of work he offers, phone number and location to profile.
• Can browse available tasks and choose the ones they want to complete.

• Make an offer to user.

• Send notification to user.

3-Admin:
• Delete task.

• Update task.

2.4.2 System Requirements:
This is considered the answer to the question - How will this system build? What software, hardware and network which will you work on?
• I mean, what is the software that I use for my son to appreciate this system?
• My data base is where I use it, for example, or where is it?
• What programming languages are used in my system?

2.4.3 Domain Requirements / Business Requirements
This is what the business needs and will benefit from by making this application or this web site
• What benefited from the work of this system in terms of the system, I mean, I am now an example of the worker in a system for selling cars and to be able to achieve a certain goal, and this means.
• They agreed to integrate the objectives of the project with the objectives of the stakeholder.
• Ensure that the BRD achieves a very wide and measurable set of process goals and that they meet customer requirements • It will be adjustable and changeable • Like you can write the BRD:
You write "the name of the project "and then the goal you want to achieve" and then write "Why do you want to achieve this goal."

The “FixFlex” platform is based on connects people looking for task services with skilled task runners in their area. Whether you need help with household chores, errands, or any other tasks.
